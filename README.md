### What I learned

Well, this is my first challenge at Frontend Mentor, and I loved every part of it. 

1. The amazing use of SVGs in web development. 
<<<<<<< HEAD
2. To ALWAYS, but ALWAYS check my links. "Of course," you will say. Fun fact: I spent almost 5 days trying to understand what happened to my SVG because it didn't show up. Only to realize that "it" was a typo in my link :\ 
3. To Don't underestimate the challenges. The challenge seemed easy, but it took me 2.5 weeks to finish, lol.

### Continued development

- I need to improve my layout skills. I have to remind myself to keep things simple. You    can waste a TON of time if you do the project layout the wrong way (in my case the complex way). 
- Although I LOVE CSS, I feel like I need to sharpen my code. Maybe I'm using too many margins and paddings because I still can't control Flexbox. 
- I'm worried about making my code readable to other coders.
- Take a counsious
